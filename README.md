# finalProject
Create a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application for managing a list of employees. The application will allow users to add, view, edit, and delete employee records. Each employee record will contain information such as name, job title, department, and salary.

Technologies Used
Node.js: JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
Express.js: Web framework for Node.js to handle HTTP requests and routing.
MySQL: Relational database to store employee data.

Setup and Configuration
Database Setup:

Create a MySQL database named employee_db.
Create a table named employees with columns for id, name, job_title, department, and salary.
Project Initialization:

Initialize a new Node.js project using npm init.
Install necessary dependencies: Express, MySQL, Body-Parser, EJS (for templating), and Nodemon (for development).
Code Description
Database Configuration (config/db.config.js):

Configure database connection using MySQL.
Employee Model (models/employee.model.js):

Define functions to interact with the database for creating, reading, updating, and deleting employee records.
Employee Controller (controllers/employee.controller.js):

Implement the logic to handle HTTP requests and use the model to interact with the database.
Employee Routes (routes/employee.routes.js):

Define routes for CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
Main Application (app.js):

Set up Express server, configure middleware, and define routes.
View Template (views/index.ejs):

Create an EJS template to render employee data in the browser.
CRUD Operations
Create: Add a new employee record.
Read: Fetch and display all employee records.
Update: Edit an existing employee record.
Delete: Remove an employee record.
Running the Project
Start the MySQL server.
Run the Node.js application using nodemon or node app.js.
Access the application through a web browser.
Sample API Endpoints
GET /employees: Fetch all employees.
POST /employees: Create a new employee.
PUT /employees/
: Update an employee by ID.
DELETE /employees/
: Delete an employee by ID.
Additional Features (Optional)
Authentication: Implement user login and registration.
Search Functionality: Allow users to search employees by name or department.
Pagination: Implement pagination for displaying a large number of records.
Validation: Add input validation to ensure data integrity.
This project provides a comprehensive introduction to building a full-stack application using Node.js, Express.js, and MySQL. It covers essential aspects like setting up the server, configuring the database, handling HTTP requests, and rendering data on the frontend.
